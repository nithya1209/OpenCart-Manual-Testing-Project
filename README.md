# OpenCart Manual Testing Project

## Project Summary
This repository contains an end-to-end manual testing project performed on the OpenCart e-commerce application.  
The project follows complete SDLC and STLC processes, starting from requirement analysis to final test sign-off.

The objective of this project is to demonstrate practical knowledge of manual testing concepts, documentation, execution, and defect management as expected in real-time industry projects.

## Test Environment
- Operating System: Windows
- Browser: Google Chrome
- Test Data: Dummy user and product data
- Tool Used for Documentation:
  - MS Excel
  - MS Word
  - GitHub

---

## Test Case Design Approach
- Test cases are designed based on:
  - Functional requirements
  - Positive and negative scenarios
  - Boundary value considerations
- Each test case includes:
  - Test Case ID
  - Test Description
  - Preconditions
  - Test Steps
  - Expected Result
  - Actual Result
  - Test Status (Pass/Fail)

---

## Defect Management
- Defects are logged with the following details:
  - Defect ID
  - Defect Summary
  - Severity
  - Priority
  - Steps to Reproduce
  - Expected Result
  - Actual Result
  - Defect Status
- Defect lifecycle followed from New → Open → Fixed → Retested → Closed

---

## Requirement Traceability
- RTM is prepared to ensure:
  - Every requirement has test coverage
  - No requirement is missed during testing
  - Clear traceability between requirements and test cases

---

## Entry and Exit Criteria
### Entry Criteria
- Requirements are reviewed and approved
- Test environment is ready
- Test cases are prepared and reviewed

### Exit Criteria
- All planned test cases executed
- Critical and high severity defects closed
- Test summary prepared
- Test sign-off completed

---

## Key Learnings
- Understanding real-time SDLC and STLC flow
- Writing structured test scenarios and test cases
- Executing test cases and documenting results
- Identifying, reporting, and tracking defects
- Maintaining traceability between requirements and test cases
- Using GitHub to maintain testing documentation
